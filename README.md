# OpenAI Custom Voice Assistant

Welcome to the OpenAI Custom Voice Assistant repository! This Python-based voice assistant leverages OpenAI's chat completion endpoint and the powerful GPT-4 language model to provide a customizable and intelligent voice interaction experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the OpenAI Custom Voice Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenAI-CustomVoiceAssistant.git
    cd OpenAI-CustomVoiceAssistant
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

    Open the `config.py` file and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your actual OpenAI API key. Instead of changing the code, I recommend using an environment variable.

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can run the OpenAI Custom Voice Assistant using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
